# Excel Data Analysis Project On Pokemon Database

Firstly, I have attached two Excel files, one is the raw Pokemon data and the other is the completed analysis of Pokemon.

## The breakdown of the Pokemon data :

                                      > Pokemon_Name: The name of the Pokemon species.
                                      > Primary_Type: The primary elemental type of the Pokemon.
                                      > Secondary_Type: The secondary elemental type of the Pokemon (if it has one)
                                      > Total_Pokemon_Count: The total number of Pokemon in the dataset.
                                      > Hit_Points: The Hit Points (HP) attribute of the Pokemon.
                                      > Attack_Points: The Attack attribute of the Pokemon.
                                      > Defense_Points: The Defense attribute of the Pokemon.
                                      > Special_Attack_Points: The Special Attack attribute of the Pokemon.
                                      > Special_Defense_Points: The Special Defense attribute of the Pokemon.
                                      > Speed_Points: The Speed attribute of the Pokemon.
                                      > Total_Points: The total sum of points across all attributes for the Pokemon.
                                      > Generation: The generation in which the Pokemon was introduced.
                                      > Legendary: A binary indicator of whether the Pokemon is legendary (1 for true, 0 for false).           


Created a DASHBOARD that describes total score points, legendary status, and generations with filters on primary type, secondary type, legendary,
and generation involves visualizing the data in a user-friendly format. Here's an outline of what the dashboard might include:
                                                                        
    > Total Score Points Distribution:
                                    > A visual representation using a bar chart showing the distribution of Pokemon based on their total score points.
                                    > This chart helps understand the overall strength distribution of Pokemon in the dataset.
    > Legendary Status Overview:
                                    > A pie chart illustrating the proportion of legendary and non-legendary Pokemon.
                                    > This gives a quick insight into the ratio of legendary to non-legendary Pokemon in the dataset.
    > Generations Comparison:
                                    > A pie chart containing the number of Pokemons in each generation.
                                    > This chart helps users understand the distribution of Pokemon across different generations.

And, there are singular sheet analyses and chart depictions of the below categories : 

    > Correlation (Hit_Points , Attack_Points , Defense_Points , Special_Attack_Points , Special_Defense_Points , Speed_Points)
    
    > Ideal Pokemon data and chart representation with trend line.

    > Type Analysis of Pokemon into each type and in detail depiction of what percentage of Pokemon is under which type.

    > Legendary(true) versus Non-Legendary(false) comparison using a radar chart to depict which areas are stronger off of the two categories and also, depiction of base stats using a line chart.
      Here, we also used a combined chart to compare the two (true/false) in one look.

    > Generation Analysis is depicted by a horizontal bar chart to compare the number of Pokemons in each geneation.
